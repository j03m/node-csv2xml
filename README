very simple script for taking a large csv and chunking it down into a few xml files.

Usage:
node csv2xml.js inputFileName numberOfChunks fieldDescriptor root row outputFilePrefix

inputFileName = the file you want to process.
numberOfChunks = numeric value indicating the number of output files.
filedDescriptors = a file with the comma separated list of column names, these will be tag names under row
root = root xml tag
row = row xml tag
outputFilePrefix = files will be named this + _chunk + number.xml
