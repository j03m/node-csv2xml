Very simple script for taking a large csv and chunking it down into a few xml files.
Works for very, very large files - but runs in a single process. Hacked together some fake xml to file streaming using createWriteStream and xmlbuilder for node. 
Doesn't accept command line params, see source to modify settings (input file, output file, chunk sizes etc)

Multiple procs coming soon.

Usage:
node lineByline.js
